# CS534 Fall 2017 Project

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You have to have the following tools in order to successfully compile the code.
```
GNU Make
GCC
SDL2
```

### Installation

In order to compile the code, please run the makefile first by executing the command: 
```
make
```

In order to clean the project folder from \*.o files, you can execute the command:
```
make clean
```

### Running the code

After you execute the make file, there will be an executable called
"cartagena", execute it using `./cartagena`

## Testing 

The `./cartagena` executable directly looks at the `main.cpp` that
stays in the project folder itself. If you changed the code, please
test it using the `main.cpp` file.

## Contributing

Please do keep in mind to run the `make` command after every time you

separate branch with

partner about master changes.
